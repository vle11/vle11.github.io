		<h1> THE PHENOMENON <br> OF "THE LOOK" </h1>
		<h2>GEORGE J. STACK AND ROBERT W. PLANT</h2>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="essay-container container align-center">
	<div class="w-1of1">The phenomenon of “the look” has been examined and analyzed in both philosophical and psychological literature. However, there has been no attempt made to indicate that the role of “the look” in, say, Jean-Paul Sartre’s phenomenology of the experience of being fixed in the gaze of the other may, in some way, be related to major psychological studies of this phenomenon. Insofar as Sartre’s phenomenological description of the encounter with “the other” via “the look” or le regard is referred to in psychological studies, it is often characterized as a description of a “pathological” response to being looked at or gazed at. This is somewhat curious insofar as a substantial number of psychological studies of reactions to gaze tend, for the most part, to substantiate or lend support to Sartre’s descriptions of “the look” and its effects. 
	</div>
	<div class="indent w-1of1"> What we will be concerned with here is an examination of some of the major psychological studies of gaze in relation to the philosophical interpretation of the significance of “the look” in Sartre’s thought. Psychological studies of the effects of being stared at or gazed at, as well as evidence uncovered in ethology pertaining to the effects of gaze, the phenomenon of the prolongation of tonic immobility in some animals and the apparent function of eye patterns in animals and insects will be considered.
	</div>
	<div class="indent w-1of1"> We shall attempt to show that there is a hitherto unnoticed continuity extending from defensive eye patterns in insects and animals to responses to gaze in animals and typical responses of human beings to being the object of the stare or gaze of others. Our supplementary concerns include the following: to maintain that Sartre’s description of typical responses to being looked at or stared at is not, by any means, an indication of a phenomenology of pathological responses and to show that Sartre’s phenomenology, despite its merits, is a truncated phenomenological description of “the look” insofar as it excludes the apparent transformation of the significance of the gaze in encounters involving interest, attention, attraction, desire or sexual intentionality. There is a great deal of common observation and empirical evidence that the typical “conflict” nature of the gaze in human encounters is overcome or transformed in special circumstances or contexts in which reciprocal staring clearly indicates interest, attention, sexual attraction or fascination.

	Sartre’s Phenomenology of “the Look”
	</div>
	<div class="w-1of1"> 
	The occasion for the introduction of a descriptive analysis of le regard or “the look” in Sartre’s Being and Nothingness is the elucidation of that mode of being that is characterized as “being-for-others.” There are forms of human behavior that suggest a reference to others. Specifically, the experiences of shame, pride and fear. However, the presentation of others to our consciousness presents something of a problem for a phenomenological description insofar as our most immediate awareness of others is as “objects” for our consciousness. Sartre offers an account of the encounter with other individuals that starts with a subjective sense of the presence of the ‘strange freedom” of another in order to bridge the gap between my consciousness of the other an as object and the other as a conscious subject. He maintains that the primitive character of this encounter between oneself and the other is as a reciprocal relationship that is experienced as “conflict.”
	</div>
	<div class="indent w-1of1"> 
	Insofar as the other cannot be, from a phenomenological perspective, an object of “knowledge,” Sartre searches for manifestations of the “Other-as-subject” that signify the presence of the other individual as a conscious subject who modifies my being and my world. Being looked at is a sign of the presence of the other as a conscious individual. Being in the face of the other in the world is a universal characteristic of our being, one that is indicated by our awareness of the “alienating reality” of the other as an anonymous
	reality. This aspect of Sartre’s thought is often overlooked in allusions to Sartre’s phenomenology in the psychological literature. What he is maintaining is that we sense that we exist in relation to an other-in-general originally and that concrete encounters with particular others are instantiations of this generalized awareness of being for an anonymous other. Being in the world in the face of a host of others is a condition of our being in which we feel that we are actual or potential objects of the gaze of an anonymous other. The generalized experience of being for another is said to be the condition for the possibility of the experience of being an object for a specific other. 
	</div>
	<div class="indent w-1of1">
	At any rate, “the look” is a signification of a direct encounter with another subjective individual. In le regard, Sartre avers, we feel objectified by others and experience ourselves as fixed in the gaze of the other individual. This objectification is experienced as the “negation” of our free consciousness or of our “transcendence” of the other. By seeking to elude this objectification of ourselves via the look, by negating ourselves as mere objective entities for the other, we testify to our “being-as-object” for another. In order to wrench ourselves away from this condition of being fixed as a determinate object in the gaze of the other, we must negate, in Sartre’s Hegelian terms, the negation of our free self-consciousness on the part of the other person who objectifies us.  
	</div>
	<div class="indent w-1of1">
	Cutting through Sartre’s elaborate and sophisticated description of the relation between oneself and others, we see that being fixed or objectified in the gaze of another indicates that one is in the presence of a subjective, conscious being. This encounter with the other entangles us in a negative “bond” with a conscious other. Expressed in terms that Sartre does not use, we may say that the experiential encounter with others by means of “the look” is primarily experienced as negating and threatening. The experiential process is complex. By seeking to negate myself as an object for another, I testify to the experience of being objectified by a conscious other person. By asserting my nonobjective freedom, I transcend the state of being fixated as an object for the gaze of another. In addition, I seek to objectify the other person by fixing him in my gaze; but the other, as Sartre expresses it, transcends my transcendence. At the heart of the relationship between oneself and the other is a dialectical tension or conflict. 
	</div>
	<div class="indent w-1of1">
	In the experience of shame or pride an individual attests to an awareness of the other individual as a consciousness that is judgmental, a consciousness that expresses itself through “the look.” Shame and pride imply our relationship to others as objects for their awareness, their judgment, their approval or disapproval. When I look at others, Sartre claims, I measure my power. And when others look at me they measure their power. 
	</div>
	<div class="indent w-1of1"> 
	What is particularly interesting in Sartre’s phenomenology is that he construes the gaze as signifying that we are objects of evaluation and judgment for conscious subjects. This cannot simply be attributed to an ostensible “pathological” projection insofar as this experience of being the “object” of the stare of others, the sense that one is being evaluated or judged by others when they stare or gaze at one, is a rather common reaction of normal individuals. By simplifying Sartre’s phenomenology of “the look” and applying his general theory of the central features of an encounter with others to psychological studies of responses to being stared at we find at least some corroboration of his assumption of the negative, conflicting nature of primordial relations between oneself and others.
	</div>
	<div class="indent w-1of1">
	Based upon the empirical data pertaining to eye contact, being stared at or gazed at, the analogies between human reactions to being stared at and the reactions of a variety of creatures to the presence of eyes or to being the object of the look of others are striking. And, in addition, they tend to support indirectly Sartre’s original description of responses to “the look.” Despite this, there are empirical findings that undermine the assumption that reactions to, or responses to, being stared at are invariably negative or are indications of a conflict relationship. Both informal observations and some psychological studies indicate that in certain contexts and under particular conditions, staring signifies attention, interest, mutual attraction, or erotic desire. In this regard, Sartre’s phenomenology of “the look” is incomplete and truncated. 
	</div>
	<div class="indent w-1of1 subtitle">
	Symbolic Transformation of “the Look” 
	</div>
	<div class="w-1of1"> 
	There are many social situations in which the gaze indicates attention, interest or fascination. The way in which a group of people
	focuses its attention on a performer, a speaker or a teacher under normal conditions is usually by means of “the look.” In fascination and curiosity there is also a tendency to focus one’s gaze upon the in- dividuals, the events, situations or phenomena that stimulate such reactions. It is clear that the social context in which staring is manifested is an important factor in determining the meaning of staring at or looking at someone. In situations in which an individual is offering a presentation, performing, giving a speech or lecturing it would be unusual for the object of visual attention to interpret staring as hostile, aggressive, or menacing. The intentionality of the gaze varies in relation to the context and the ambience in which it is manifested. In addition, of course, the relationship between the individuals engaged in reciprocal gazing affects the interpretation of the meaning of being stared at. It may be the case that a kind of sublimation of a more primitive response to “the look” takes place and permissible eye contact is tacitly accepted. Or it may be that the context, circumstances, or social relations that prevail being about a symbolic transformation of the meaning of “the look.” 
	</div>
	<div class="indent w-1of1"> 
	That something like a symbolic transformation of the primordial signification of gazing may actually take place in certain contexts is supported by the two-factor theory of emotion that has been postulated in psychological theory. We have already seen that being stared at elicits a measurable emotional or physiological arousal. This arousal state, according to the two-factor theory, is subject to various interpretations. Thus, an immediate response to being stared at that induces tension, discomfort, anxiety, or fear may be transformed by virtue of a reinterpretation of the initial emotional arousal. The cognitive interpretation of a subjective arousal state would, no doubt, be affected by contextual cues. The social context, then, would determine the nature of the interpretation of an initial arousal state. Both the context and the behavior of the individual who is staring may elicit contradictory and inhibiting factors that transform the more typical, negative responses to being the object of the gaze of others. When an individual is interesting to another, the eye contact involved in this situation may simply indicate fascination or interest. The social situation conditions the response to being the object of the gaze of another or of others. The arousal reaction may be similar to the response to being looked at that elicits negative reactions, but the meaning of the emotional state is transformed.
	</div>
	<div class="indent w-1of1"> 
	The typical reciprocal staring or persistent eye contact in situations in which two individuals are emotionally or sexually attracted to
	one another indicates that the subjective meaning of the encounter is a highly relevant factor. Curiously enough, the prolongation of tonic immobility in small animals that was induced by eye contact and conditioned by the pupil size of the eyes finds its symbolically transformed simulacrum in erotically tinged eye contact. It has been found that an increase in pupil size is an indication of emotional arousal and attraction. Conversely, large pupils are perceived as more attractive than smaller pupils. Here we have an apparent reversal of previously indicated responses. Prolonged eye contact, intense staring and large pupil size are, under certain conditions and in certain social contexts, experienced as signs of attraction, interest, or desire. A conscientious phenomenology of “the look” must accommodate these polarities of response to being the object of the gaze of another. It would appear that there is a cultural transformation of primitive reactions to “the look” that enables man to reinterpret its meaning in social contexts in which negative responses to being gazed at would be inhibited or inappropriate. In terms of the polarities discussed, it would seem that the intentionality of the look is interpreted in radically different ways. The apparent break with the continuity running through the negative reactions to being gazed upon may be accounted for in terms of the symbolic transformation of specific experiences by means of an infusion of cultural meaning. Perhaps the negative reactions to “the look” in man are residues of primitive, natural responses to eye contact or to being stared at. And perhaps the positive responses to being gazed at are the result of a kind of cultural transsubstantiation of primordial reactions.
	</div>
	<div class="indent w-1of1"> 
	Although we cannot pretend to have dealt with all of the relevant dimensions of the phenomenon of “the look,” we have indicated a curious continuity in the responses to, or the effects produced by, eye contact or staring that can be traced from the lower organisms to man. One consequence of this discovery is that Sartre’s phenomenological description of le regard is neither peculiar nor exclusively appropriate, as some psychologists believe, to pathological reactions to being the object of the look of others. On the other hand, we have shown that Sartre’s phenomenology of the experience of being stared at is incomplete and, in terms of current empirical knowledge, ultimately inaccurate. Although a phenomenology need not be restricted by empirical findings nor, in its classic form, affected by empirical data at all, we believe that when the method of phenomenology is applied to phenomena that have been and are objects of study in the empirical sciences, it should not fly in the face of experimental data. If phenomenology is to be more than a kind of subjective, introspective report, it should, ideally, take into consideration currently available empirical information pertaining to the phenomenon it purports to describe. By doing so, it only enhances its validity and its persuasive power. In the case of the phenomenon of “the look,” we have seen that a great deal of the empirical data seems to substantiate what has sometimes been characterized as an idiosyncratic phenomenology. That Sartre’s unique description of “the look” is incomplete and in need of revision does not undermine the validity of its intuitive insights.
