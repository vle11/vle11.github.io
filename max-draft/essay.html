    <h1>THE PHENOMENON <br> OF "THE LOOK"</h1>
    <h2>GEORGE J. STACK AND ROBERT W. PLANT</h2>

    The phenomenon of “the look” has been examined and analyzed in both philosophical and psychological literature. However, there has been no attempt made to indicate that the role of “the look” in, say, Jean-Paul Sartre’s phenomenology of the experience of being fixed in the gaze of the other may, in some way, be related to major psychological studies of this phenomenon. Insofar as Sartre’s phenomenological description of the encounter with “the other” via “the look” or le regard is referred to in psychological studies, it is often characterized as a description of a “pathological” response to being looked at or gazed at. This is somewhat curious insofar as a substantial number of psychological studies of reactions to gaze tend, for the most part, to substantiate or lend support to Sartre’s descriptions of “the look” and its effects.

    What we will be concerned with here is an examination of some of the major psychological studies of gaze in relation to the philosophical interpretation of the significance of “the look” in Sartre’s thought. Psychological studies of the effects of being stared at or gazed at, as well as evidence uncovered in ethology pertaining to the effects of gaze, the phenomenon of the prolongation of tonic immobility in some animals and the apparent function of eye patterns in animals and insects will be considered.

  <div class="indent">
    We shall attempt to show that there is a hitherto unnoticed continuity extending from defensive eye patterns in insects and animals to responses to gaze in animals and typical responses of human beings to being the object of the stare or gaze of others. Our supplementary concerns include the following: to maintain that Sartre’s description of typical responses to being looked at or stared at is not, by any means, an indication of a phenomenology of pathological responses and to show that Sartre’s phenomenology, despite its merits, is a truncated phenomenological description of “the look” insofar as it excludes the apparent transformation of the significance of the gaze in encounters involving interest, attention, attraction, desire or sexual intentionality. There is a great deal of common observation and empirical evidence that the typical “conflict” nature of the gaze in human encounters is overcome or transformed in special circumstances or contexts in which reciprocal staring clearly indicates interest, attention, sexual attraction or fascination.
